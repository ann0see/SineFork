# SineFork
A digital pitch fork to give pitch from your wrist. SineFork is useful for conductors, choir singers - or anyone needing a note quickly without a piano.
SineFork generates sine tones from your Apple Watch and has an adjustable base frequency of the concert A.

## Disclaimer

SineFork is a hobby project to allow me getting used to Swift development. The code was proposed by AI but still heavily influenced in its design by prompting.
Do not expect high quality code here: At the moment, there are no tests or CI set up.

This app is FLOSS. I am more than happy about any contributions.
